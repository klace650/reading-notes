# Linked Lists:

- Sequence of `Nodes`  
- Contains `next` in the link  
- Two types of `Nodes`  
  1. Singly  
  2. Doubly  
## Some Terms:  
- Linked List:  Data structure / contains nodes that point to the next node.  
- Singly: Means there is only one reference to both the next node.
- Doubly: Means there are two references to the next node - `Next` and `Previous`  
- Node: Item that contains data 
- Next: Each node has this, contains the ref from the next node.
- Head:  First node in a linked-list  
- Current:  Refers to the node currently being looked at in the code.

- Traversal only possible with `next` value
- Can only use a while loop to make it happen
